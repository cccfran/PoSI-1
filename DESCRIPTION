Description: 
  In linear LS regression, calculate for a given design matrix
  the multiplier K of coefficient standard errors such that the
  confidence intervals [b - K*SE(b), b + K*SE(b)] have a
  guaranteed coverage probability for all coefficient estimates
  b in any submodels after performing arbitrary model selection.
